# Job Application Tracker

The main point of this app is to track to which companies the user has sent their resume to as well as positions.

In order to do this I need to have the ability to login for the website. This will be the main point of learning for me this time.

Requirements:
- Pick the method of database storage as well as login
- A method to input text information such as location data from google, website link and other such things
